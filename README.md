# revshell_c2
a server that can accept multiple revshell requests while continuing to run




# Features that I plan on implementing
- Server can run constantly and always accept revshel connections
- Connections open up in a new window and are kept alive as long as possible for the user to use them
- A command which will try to establish persistance automatically by installing some custom software as a user-level systemd service (or equivalent in windows)
